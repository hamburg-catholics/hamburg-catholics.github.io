  <h3>Current COVID-19 Regulations</h3>
  <p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/Themenbereich-Corona_Coronavirus-Erzbistum-Hamburg">coronavirus guidelines</a> issued by the Archdiocese, here are some details about how English language masses are run at St. Elisabeth until further notice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have any symptoms of illness, if you are in a high-risk group, or if you aren't able to sit for an hour with a mask fully covering your nose and mouth, please don't attend mass in person. There are many options for attending mass online.</li>
    <li>All parishioners will be required to sign in at the entrance, disinfect their hands, and wear a mask during mass (except children below 7, who must remain with their parents). Ushers will seat you in a specific pew when you arrive.</li>
    <li>We are limited to 40 households in the church at a time. If we run out of space, we will unfortunately need to turn people away at the door. We do not accept reservations for seats; for the best chance of getting a seat, please arrive 10-15 minutes early.</li>
  </ul>
