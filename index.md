Welcome to the website of the Hamburg English Speaking Community.
This website is still under construction. But here's some information for you to get started off!

We are a vibrant community of English Speaking Catholics from across the Globe.

### Sunday Services

Mass in English at 12:00 noon at St. Elisabeth's

#### Current COVID Regulations
In addition to the coronavirus guidelines issued by the Archdiocese, here are some details about how masses are run at St. Elisabeth:

- We can only have 40 households in the church at a time. If we run out of space, we will unfortunately need to turn people away at the door. For the best chance of getting a seat, please arrive 10-15 minutes early.
- All parishioners will be required to sign in at the entrance, disinfect their hands, and wear a mask during mass (except children below 7, who must remain with their parents). Ushers will seat you in a specific pew when you arrive.
