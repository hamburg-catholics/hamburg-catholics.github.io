## Current COVID-19 Regulations

In addition to the [coronavirus guidelines](https://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/Themenbereich-Corona_Coronavirus-Erzbistum-Hamburg) issued by the Archdiocese of Hamburg, here are some details about how English language masses are run at St. Elisabeth until further notice:
* If you have any symptoms of illness, if you are in a high-risk group (60+, lung, heart, or immune issues), or have any symptoms, please don't attend mass in person. There are many options for attending mass online. If you attend church regularly, please consider staggering your visits (every 2 or 3 Sundays) so that others can have a chance to participate in the mass.
* We are limited to a small number of households in the church at a time, with some overflow space in the parish hall (Gemeindehaus) where the mass can be viewed on a video feed (with Holy Communion). If we run out of space, we will unfortunately need to turn people away. We do not accept reservations for seats; for the best chance of getting a seat, please arrive 10-15 minutes early.
* All parishioners will be required to provide their name and phone (or email) at the entrance for contact tracing, disinfect their hands with the provided disinfectant, and wear a mask during mass (except children below 7, who must remain with their parents).
* Ushers will seat you in a specific pew when you arrive. Please don't change seats without talking to an usher first, and try to avoid moving around the church any more than is absolutely necessary.
* There is a choir at each mass, but community singing is not allowed. Please do not sing during the mass. Spoken responses and prayers are allowed.
* During Holy Communion, everyone processes to the altar, whether they are receiving communion or not. Receive communion in your hands with your mask on, then take several steps to the side, and briefly remove your mask to consume the host. If you are not prepared to receive communion (for any reason), you may indicate this to the priest by crossing your arms over your chest, and you will receive a blessing.
