* The &quot;3G&quot; proofs are checked at the main entrance by our door managers. 
* In addition to the documents/proofs to be shown (electronic or printed), please also have a photo ID ready, in case the door managers do not know you. 
* Checks will take place upon entry only. 
* Wearing a FFP2 mask (for liturgical servers/ministers) or medical mask for the rest is mandatory when entering the church.

Here are some additional details about how English language masses are run at St. Elisabeth until further notice:

* If you have any symptoms of illness or are in a high-risk group (60+, lung, heart, or immune issues), please don't attend mass in person.
There are many options for attending mass online.
If you attend church regularly, please consider staggering your visits (every 2 or 3 Sundays) so that others can have a chance to participate in the mass.

* We are limited to a small number of households in the church at a time, and occasionally offer overflow seating in the parish hall (Gemeindehaus) where the mass can be viewed on a video feed (with Holy Communion).
If we run out of space, we will unfortunately need to turn people away.
We do not accept reservations for seats; for the best chance of getting a seat, please arrive 10-15 minutes early.

* All parishioners will be required to provide their name and phone (or email) at the entrance for contact tracing, and disinfect their hands before entering the church. We also support registration using the [Luca](https://www.luca-app.de/) app or the [CoronaWarn](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/) app

* Parishioners, celebrants, and lectors are required to wear a mask at all times while inside the church.
Everyone over the age of 14 is required to wear a "medical mask" (surgical mask or FFP2/N95/KN95); cloth masks are no longer sufficient.
Children between 7-14 must wear a mask, but it may be a cloth mask.
Children under the age of 7 are not required to wear a mask, but must remain with their parents for the duration of the mass.
Learn more about [mask types and requirements](https://www.hamburg.de/corona-maske/14847194/medizinische-masken/).

* Please take a seat at a vacant pew when you arrive.
Please don't change seats, and try to avoid moving around the church any more than is absolutely necessary.

* There is a choir at each mass, but community singing is not allowed.
Please do not sing during the mass.
Spoken responses and prayers are allowed.

* During Holy Communion, process to the altar, whether you are receiving communion or not.
Receive the host in your hands with your mask on, then take several steps to the side, and briefly remove your mask to consume the host.
If you are not prepared to receive communion (for any reason), you may indicate this to the priest by crossing your arms over your chest, and you will receive a blessing.

* At the end of mass, after the last hymn, please exit the church row by row.
